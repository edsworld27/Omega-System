# OMEGA CONSTITUTION PACK — v9

**Build anything with AI, the right way.**

---

## What It Does

1. **Keeps AI safe** — Security rules that can't be bypassed
2. **Ensures nothing gets missed** — Requirements validated before building
3. **Works on any model** — Smart loading, not context hoarding
4. **Adapts to you** — Full guidance or just build, your choice

---

## Choose Your Mode

| Mode | For | How |
|:-----|:----|:----|
| **Full Discovery** | New projects, want guidance | Copy [RUN.md](RUN.md), AI guides you |
| **Quick Start** | You know what you want | Fill seeds first, AI validates |
| **Lite Mode** | Smaller models, simple builds | Use [OMEGA_LITE.md](OMEGA_LITE.md) |
| **Just Build** | Skip to code | Use [ignition/JUST_BUILD.md](ignition/JUST_BUILD.md) |

**Start here:** [RUN.md](RUN.md) has all prompts.

## How It Works

```
Constitution (rules)    →    AI scans, summarises    →    Works from memory
     ↓                              ↓                           ↓
All 95 files exist         Writes to SESSION_CONTEXT.md    Loads files as needed
```

The AI doesn't hoard everything in context. It reads what it needs, takes notes, and references its memory. This means:
- Works on smaller models
- Faster responses
- State persists across sessions
