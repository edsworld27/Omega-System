## v9.5 — 2026-02-26

### Context Offloading & Daemon Automation
- Added `omega_reporter.py` script to run in background daemon
- Daemon aggressively scans `project/` for structural violations
- Violations are logged to a lightweight `USER SPACE/logging/` folder
- Drastically reduces XML token overhead for autonomous IDE agents
- `omega.py` wizard now automatically scaffolds `logging/`

### Constitution Bot Integration (v9.6)
- Created the new `ConstitutionAgent` in the Python Telegram backend (`mac-commander`).
- Agent controls a structured 4-step interview directly from the Telegram UI.
- Securely drops `FOUNDER_JOB-[ID].md` into `dev-work/hive/telegram_inbox/` for Claude Code to execute.
- Wired natural language triggers into `SimpleBrain` pattern matcher.

### Mode-Based Checkpoint Autonomy
- Updated `INSTRUCTOR.xml` Prime Directives
- Added explicit `<checkpoint_autonomy>` block
- Autonomous IDE extensions (Antigravity/Cursor) can now self-approve non-critical checkpoints when operating in `JUST BUILD` or `QUICK START` mode.
- Preserved strict human-gates for CP-5 (Dependencies) and CP-10 (Release).

### IDE Agent Routing
- Added explicit `<directory_enforcement>` to `INSTRUCTOR.xml`
- AI must now write production code exclusively into `USER SPACE/project/`
- Added `.cursorrules` to root, binding native IDE agents (Cursor/Antigravity) to the Constitution

### Constitution Bot Ideation
- Replaced `future-kits/` with `ideation/CONSTITUTION_BOT.md`
- Added vision for remote Telegram orchestration
- Moved bot backend secrets to `ideation/resource/` and added to `.gitignore`

### Structured Onboarding Flow
- Created ONBOARDING.md with mandatory interview sequence
- Added CP-ONBOARD checkpoint (before CP-0)
- Rewrote RUN.md with single master prompt
- Enforces: Mode → Project Type → Existing Work → Purpose
- One question at a time, no deviation

- CONTEXT_DEV.md — working memory
- CHANGES_DEV.md — this changelog

### USER SPACE Restructure
