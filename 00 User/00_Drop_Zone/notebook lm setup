🚀 AntiGravity + NotebookLM: The Ultimate Combinations

Library
🚀 Notebook (AntiGravity)


All below, enjoy 🤘







1. Connect Antigravity to NotebookLM
Copy and paste the below 👇

Install and set up the NotebookLM MCP server for me:

Install the notebooklm-mcp-server package using uv (or pip if uv isn't available)

Add it to my MCP configuration file (usually at ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json or similar)

Run the authentication command (notebooklm-mcp-auth) and open a browser to authorize it

Verify the installation is working by listing my NotebookLM notebooks

Make sure to:

Use the correct installation method for my system

Configure the MCP server properly in my config file

Guide me through the browser authentication process

Confirm everything is working at the end

You must add this here once completed: @mcp_config.json

You may need to make sure the user is signed out of their browser before doing this.





The Brain + The Builder. NotebookLM researches, analyzes, and creates. AntiGravity takes action, builds, and automates. Together? Unstoppable.
