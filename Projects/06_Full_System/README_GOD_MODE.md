# 🚨 06_Full_System: THE "GOD-MODE" SANDBOX
**Confidentiality:** MAXIMUM  
**Role:** The Architect's Nexus

This directory is the absolute nerve center of the Omega Framework. 

INSIDE the folder for saftey includes a dev version with all the files this you may edit at any time then in has a liver files never edit the live files only the dev files until you are asked to push the dev files to repos you must upload the dev files into the the live files then the live files to the repos...

Do not treat this as a standard project folder. This is a **live orchestration environment** containing active Git clones of every single repository in the ecosystem.

## 🏗️ The Contents

You will find the complete 4-Repo Triad nested within this directory:

1. `omega-constitution/` (The Rules Data Lake)
https://github.com/edsworld27/omega-constitution 

2. `omega-store/` (The Starter Kits) 
https://github.com/edsworld27/omega-store

3. `omega-claw/` (The Python Automation)
https://github.com/edsworld27/omega-claw 

4. `Omega System Public/` (The isolated Execution Shell used for testing)
https://github.com/edsworld27/Omega-System

## 🔄 The CI/CD "God-Mode" Workflow

Because all 4 constituent repositories exist locally within this single context window, you (or your AI agent) have unprecedented visibility over the entire ecosystem.

**How to Execute Global Updates:**

1. **Context Loading:** Open Claude Desktop or Cursor IDE and set the root workspace to `06_Full_System/`. The AI now has absolute knowledge of the Constitution rules, the executable Python scripts, and the downstream Store templates. 
2. **Cross-Repo Mutating:** Instruct your AI to make a change.
   > *"Update the Website Kit in the `omega-store` folder to include Stripe billing, and then update the `SECURITY.xml` in the `omega-constitution` folder to include new payment rules."*
3. **Validation:** The AI edits the local files. You review the diffs.
4. **The Deployment Phase:**
   Because each nested folder (`omega-store`, `omega-constitution`, etc.) retains its original `.git` bindings to its respective upstream repository, you simply deploy the changes individually:
   ```bash
   cd omega-constitution
   git add . && git commit -m "Update SECURITY.xml for Stripe billing"
   git push

   cd ../omega-store
   git add . && git commit -m "Add Stripe billing to Website Kit"
   git push
   ```
5. **Instant Live Propagation:** The absolute millisecond those pushes succeed on GitHub, every public execution shell dynamically inherits the updates the next time a user runs `omega.py` or the `server-github` MCP prompt.

**You have just updated an entire ecosystem's logic framework and asset library globally, zero LLM hallucination, zero manual package downloads.**

## 🛑 Critical Warnings

*   **NEVER** run a blanket `git add .` from the root of `06_Full_System` if you intend to push changes to the public system. You *must* `cd` into the specific repository you are modifying.
*   The `06_Full_System` folder itself is tracked individually by the parent `omega-dev` repository to preserve its existence, but the nested repos are tracked by their respective upstreams.

they each have their own git repos and can be pushed to github independently. When asksed to update the system, make sure to update all 4 repos.
