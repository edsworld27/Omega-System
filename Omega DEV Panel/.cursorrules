# Omega DEV BUILD Workspace

You are assisting the system architect in maintaining the Omega Ecosystem.

**🔴 META-DEV MODE RULES:**
Whenever you are asked to evaluate, plan, test, or log changes regarding the creation of the Constitution, Store, or Claw:
1. **READ FIRST**: `META_DEV_MODE.xml` in this directory.
2. **LOG DISCRETELY**: Always create a *new file* prefixed with the version number (e.g., `v10.0.1_bugfix.md`) inside the respective folder:
   - `Evaluations/`
   - `Implementations/`
   - `Testing/`
   - `Changle Log/`

DO NOT pollute the pristine end-user `Constution V10/` framework repository with your active development scratchpad files.
